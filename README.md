# Blood-Reign-Community-Hub

A community-driven project for Heartwood Online, offering a variety of resources and tools to enhance the gaming experience. We provide a custom Discord bot featuring in-game tips, guides, and essential information to support players. Our community-driven wiki serves as an all-encompassing knowledge base, designed to help players of all levels navigate the world of Heartwood Online. In addition to these tools, we also run an active guild, Blood Reign, where like-minded players come together to progress and enjoy the game.
